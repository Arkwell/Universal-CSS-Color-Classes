# Universal-CSS-Color-Classes
This CSS file contains every possible colour combination and assigns it a corresponding class. You can add any colour to any element by just referencing the colour you want in HEX. It's a rather pointless file, extremely resource-heavy, but more of a test in AI than anything. This file would take months to create 50 years ago. It took me 6 seconds.
